                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I am a passionate and creative web developer with a strong foundation in front-end development. With a keen eye for design and a commitment to creating engaging user experiences, I strive to bring projects to life through clean, efficient, and maintainable code.</p>
          <p>My journey in web development began during my college years, where I discovered my love for coding and design. Since then, I have honed my skills through various projects and professional experiences, constantly seeking to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, experimenting in the kitchen, or diving into a good book. I am also a firm believer in giving back to the community and enjoy volunteering my time to support local initiatives.</p>

                    <h3>E-commerce Website</h3>
                    <p>For this project, I collaborated with a team to build a fully functional e-commerce website using React.js and Node.js. Our goal was to create a seamless shopping experience for users, complete with product listings, cart functionality, and secure checkout. I contributed to the front-end development, implementing reusable components and integrating state management with Redux.</p>

                    <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
              <p>This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed and developed this responsive website to serve as my online portfolio. It features a clean and modern design, with sections for About Me, Projects, and Contact. I utilized CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure optimal viewing across various devices.</p>
